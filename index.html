            <h2>All Too Well </h2>
            <p>
                As a hardcore Swiftie, my favorite short film is the
                "All Too Well" music video. Especially at this time of 
                year, I love to watch this short film. It occurs in autumn,
                and the film features Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien.

            <h2>A Failed Relationship</h2>
            <p>
                The film follows the relationship of Taylor Swift and Jake
                Gyllenhaal. There was a nine year age gap between the two.
                Taylor Swift was 20 and Jake Gyllenhaal was 29. It seems the 
                relationship ended on her 21st birthday. He didn't show up on her
                birthday and she ended up crying in a bathroom.
            </p>
            <h2>A Happy Ending for Taylor</h2>
            <p>
                However, this wasn't the first crack in the relationship. 
                The short film portrays the couple arguing when Jake made fun
                of Taylor in front of his friends. He refused to help her with
                housework, and often treated her like an inferior. The two
                break up, and the film ends by portraying Taylor as a successful
                author.
